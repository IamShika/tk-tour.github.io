# Topic description :
- Why develop this?
  So in research class, Teacher gave us a topic, "Think of an invention for the final project."
  We couldn't think any better idea on what to do for an invention that no one "in our school" have done before.
  So, me and my boys started brain storming and one of us came up with.... "A website for a school map"
  Why did he think of this such things? Its because he is the new student here at our school, and often times new student gets lost in new school
  didn't know where the class is, didn't know where to go, where is cafeteria, etc.
  And as for that, That idea came up. And the final project

  To make it short, Its because he got lost in shcool and want something to navigate him.

- Lore?
  Ah, yes. Everything has lore behind it. So here. from the question N1, after we got the idea, we made a progress just a little bit.
  using chatGPT... it absolutely was a waste of time using chatGPT developing this websiste. Like, the UI looks old as hell.
  everything uhm.. $`\textcolor{pink}{\text{F*cked}}`$ up a bunch of times because chatGPT kept forgetting the code and not following instructions very well.
  So the porject was just going to be discontinued... but I accidentally bumped into an AI, named Claude. A very very skilled coder AI.
  So I went to update this project by using Claude, And Guess what? Claude fixes all the issue, created us a new JS, make the UI looks simple.
  make everything just looks clean. And clearly Claude didn't had problems like ChatGPT do. I swear, if we are still using chatGPT, This project is not getting anywhere.
  We're having fun developing this project with Claude right now. We'll start moving again now.

- Any tips?
  Try changing your language into Traditional Thai, It's funny. and I hope you didn't have a volume on max.
